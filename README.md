## Connect4 Agent

28 April Update:

Working to understand pushing to the repository from the cmd; was able to copy the working files and push them.

Currently have two file destinations:

  ~/Desktop/pycharm/PCP/agent0/ (working on the code)
  
  ~/Users/lcube/pcp-connect4-agent/ (pushing to git)
  
Feeling ok with the material so far. Not too confident with using git from the cmd, although the knowledge is slowly coming together.
First time using pytest, or any testing at all. Was able to get very basic tests written as well as each of the functions. Have to used string_to_board as I don't see a use for it with my implementation. At the moment am stuck on getting the connected_four function to work correctly.
